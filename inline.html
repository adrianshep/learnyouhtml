    <p>Lorem ipsum <sub>dolor sit amet</sub>, consectetur adipisicing elit</p>
    <p>Lorem ipsum <span>dolor sit amet</span>, consectetur adipisicing elit</p>
  </body>

 ```

# You're doing fine!

 Of course that's not all of existing inline tags, but these 5 is the most
 common used tags, so you definitely should know about them. Feel free to
 google about other tags. There are tags for different purposes like
 quoting, addressing, code, deletions and additions, keyboard keys and so
 on.

 Nevertheless, we need to know how to make headings for dividing content by
 logical parts. That's what we are consider in following exercise.

INLINE TAGS (Exercise 4 of 11)

  You know how to create an paragraph of text, so it's enough to write your
  own book using HTML! Sometimes we meet highlighted words in books, like
  definitions or something. Unfortunately, you don't know how to highlight
  words in HTML. However, you're here, so that's easy to fix.

 ### Font faces

  If you need to make a part of text bolder, then don't forget about
  <strong> or <b> tags. Use them as in following example:

     <p>Here are few <strong>important</strong> words</p>

  This HTML markup will produce this result:

  |> Here are few important words.

  In case with italic highlighting, use <em> or <i> tags:

     <p>Here are few <em>important</em> words</p>

  Preview:

  |> Here are few important words.

  <b> and <strong>, as well as <i> and <em> produce similar results in
  browsers. However, they aren't equivalents and interchangeable. <b> means
  just bold text, at the same time <strong> is a tag of logical markup and
  highlights the tagged text. Here again with <i> which means italic text
  and <em> for emotional highlighted words.

 ### Upper and lower indexes

  An index relative to a text is the shift (up or down) of characters
  relative to the baseline. Depending on shifting, the index is called,
  upper index or lower index. They are actively used in mathematics,
  physics, chemistry and to designate units of measurement. Obviously, there
  are corresponding tags in HTML for lower and upper indexes:

   » <sup> - upper index
   » <sub> - lower index

  The text placed in one of these containers is designated by a smaller size
  than the base text and shifted relative to the horizontal. Consider an
  example:

     <p><b>The formula of sulfuric acid:</b> <i>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></i></p>

     <p><b>Pythagoras's theorem:</b> a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup></p>

  Preview:

  |> The formula of sulfuric acid: H₂SO₄

  |> Pythagoras's theorem: a² + b² = c²

 ### Grouping inline elements

  Sometimes you need to wrap some text or other elements in a tag which
  which does not inherently represent anything, for example, for styling
  purposes. <span> tag is exactly for this purpose. It is a generic inline
  container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent
  anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes, or
  because they share attribute values. It should be used only when no other
  semantic element is appropriate.

  Use <span> like this:

     <p>Lorem ipsum <span>dolor sit amet</span>, consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>

  For now, <span> may seem useless for you, but believe it's one of the most
  common usable tag in HTML.

 ### Pitfalls

  Any number of spaces are displayed as one in the browser. These three
  paragraphs will look exactly the same in the browser:

     <p>one. two. three<p>
     <p>one.    two.    three<p>
     <p>one.        two.        three<p>

  HTML doesn't support hyphenation in words, as text editors do, in other
  words, all words are written entirely without splitting them.

  Text takes up the whole width of the browser window. If you just write one
  long line in the HTML code, then in the browser it will be formatted, so
  that text will fit whole width of the window. If this text is wider than
  the browser's window, then a horizontal scroll bar would appear.

  You can use a special character entity references. You can define them
  like this: &name;, where name - is a name of entity reference. Here is a
  few of them:

   » &​quot; - double quotation mark (")
   » &​amp; - ampersand (&)
   » &​apos; - apostrophe (apostrophe-quote) (')
   » &​lt; - less-than sign (<)
   » &​gt; - greater-than sign (>)

  Read more about these entities here:

  ences)

 ## THE CHALLENGE

  In this exercise you need to create 5 paragraphs of any text and use
  <strong>, <em>, <sup>, <sub> and <span> tag in these paragraphs, one tag
  per paragraph.
