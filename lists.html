    # Great!

    Nice to see you're get how to write lists in HTML.

    Additionally, there is no limitation to the depth and alternation of nested lists defined with the `<ol>` and `<ul>` elements. This markup will work as well:

    ```html
    <ol>
      <li>first item</li>
      <li>second item  <!- closing </li> tag not here! ->
        <ul>
          <li>second item first subitem</li>
          <li>second item second subitem</li>
          <li>second item third subitem</li>
        </ul>
      </li>            <!- Here's the closing </li> tag ->
      <li>third item</li>
    </ol>

 There are cases when it's not enough to summarize information in a simple
 list, that's where tables come. In following exercise we're going to take
 a look at tables in HTML.

LISTS (Exercise 6 of 11)

  Often it's better to show data in form of list with items. HTML gives you
  tags for this case. There are three types of lists in HTML:

   1. Ordered list
   2. Unordered list
   3. Definitions list

  Let's consider them in this exercise.

 ### Ordered lists

  If you need to create a list with numbered items, you should use <ol> tag.
  A <ol> is stands for ordered list and represents an ordered list of items,
  typically rendered as a numbered list.

  A list item can be described using <li> tag, which stands for list item.
  Consider this example with ordered list markup:

     <ol>
       <li>first item</li>
       <li>second item</li>
       <li>third item</li>
     </ol>

  Preview:

   1. first item
   2. second item
   3. third item

  Typically, ordered-list items are displayed with a preceding numbering,
  which can be of any form, like numerals, letters or Romans numerals or
  even simple bullets.

  A <ol> tag have useful attributes:

   » type - indicates the numbering type, may has one of these values:   » 1
     indicates numbers (default);
        » a indicates lowercase letters;
           » A indicates uppercase letters;
           » i indicates lowercase Roman numerals;
           » I indicates uppercase Roman numerals.

   » start - this integer attribute specifies the start value for numbering
     the individual list items. Although the ordering type of list elements
     might be Roman numerals, such as XXXI, or letters, the value of start
     is always represented as a number.
   » reversed - a boolean attribute specifies that the items of the list are
     specified in reversed order.

 ### Unordered lists

  Unordered lists look similar to ordered ones. Describing of list items
  remains the same, keep using <li> tag. The main difference is that you
  need to wrap all list items in <ul> tag, which stands for unordered list.
  <ul> tag represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a
  bulleted list.

  The <ul> element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a
  numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless.

  Example:

     <ul>
       <li>first item</li>
       <li>second item</li>
       <li>third item</li>
     </ul>

  Preview:

   » first item
   » second item
   » third item

  Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be
  of several forms, like a dot, a circle or a squared.

  If you need to set the bullet style for the list, take a look at type
  attribute. It can take these values:

   » circle
   » disc
   » square

 ### Definitions lists

  In some cases you need to implement glossary or to display a list of
  key-value pairs. There is <dl> tag for such needs. <dl> stands for
  definitions list and is used to encloses a list of groups of terms and
  descriptions.

  Terms are enclosed in <dt> tag, which means definition term. Definitions
  are wrapped in <dd> tags.

  Example with single term and description:

     <dl>
       <dt>HTML</dt>
       <dd>
         The standard markup language for
         creating web pages and web applications.
       </dd>

       <!- Other terms and descriptions ->
     </dl>

  Also, you can write multiple terms with single definition, single term
  with my multiple definitions or multiple terms with multiple definitions.

 ## THE CHALLENGE

  In your HTML document create three lists:

   1. ordered list with 3 items
   2. unordered list with 3 items
   3. definition list with 2 pairs of term and definition

  The content of list items is up to you.
