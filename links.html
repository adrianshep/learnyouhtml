# Good!

 Now you know how to make a links between documents. Cool, right?

 Are you wondering about how we can create a button or input field with
 html? Actually, HTML provides special tag for that purposes. Moreover, you
 can even compose few control elements in a form. In the next exercise
 we're gonna take a look at forms and form elements.

LINKS AND REFERENCES (Exercise 9 of 11)

  Links are the basis of hypertext documents and allow you to move from one
  web page to another. The link can lead not only to HTML-files, but also to
  a file of any type, and this file can be placed even on another site. The
  main thing is to have access to the document to which the link is made.

  To create a link, you need to tell the browser what is the link, and also
  specify the address of the document to which you want to link. Both
  actions are performed using the <a> (anchor) tag:

     <a href="https://google.com/">Google</a>

  An href attribute contains a URL or a URL fragment that the hyperlink
  points to.

  Besides href, links also have a lot of useful attributes. Here are the
  most important of them:

   » download - this attribute instructs browsers to download a URL instead
     of navigating to it.
   » target - specifies where to display the linked URL. It is a name of, or
     keyword for, a browsing context: a tab, window, etc.

  Moreover, you also can put an image inside of link, so you'll get an
  clickable image, like this:

     <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">
       <img src="path/to/google-logo.png"
            alt="Google logo" />
     </a>

  In example above, we are defining the link to Google's main page using
  image. By the way, we've specified a target="_blank", which means this
  link will be opened in new browser window.

  It's common to create links that open in the user's email program to allow
  them to send a new message. This is done with a mailto: link. Here's a
  simple example:

     <a href="mailto:email@someone.com">Send email to someone</a>

 ## THE CHALLENGE

  In this exercise you have to create a clickable image (link with image).
  Use any image and any link you like.

  task.
