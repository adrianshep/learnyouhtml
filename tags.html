<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello, world!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      O for a muse of fire
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention!
    </p>

Here's the official solution in case you want to compare notes:

 ```html <!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Tags</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>first paragraph</p>
    <hr>
    <p>second paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html>


    # Neat!

    Now you know how basic HTML document looks like.

    Here we need to tell you more about how you can use tags. Tags are case
    insensitive, so `<br>`, `<BR>`, `<Br>` and `<bR>` works exactly the same.
    Anyway, we recommend you to write tags in lower case, which is more readable
    and generally accepted.

    If a tag is written with mistake, then browser will ignore this tag, so it
    would looks like there is no any tag.

    Important, there is a special kind of tag: comment. Like in any markup or
    programming language, sometimes you need to leave a message in your code, so
    you write comment. In HTML comments are declared using this:

    ```html                                   -->
    <!-- this is a single-line comment -->

    <!--
      this
      is
      a
      multi-line
      comment
    -->
<!--
 Use comments to describe specific places in your code. That might be
 helpful for other developers, including you, to understand this markup in
 future.

 Okay, let's go back to the <meta charset="utf-8">. It doesn't look like a
 usual tag. What is charset="utf-8"? Well, this is an attribute with value
 and we're going to consider them in following exercise.

TAGS (Exercise 2 of 11)

  HTML uses special bits of programming language called tags to let the
  browser know how a webpage should look. The tags usually come in pairs: an
  opening tag to tell the browser when to start doing something, and an
  ending tag to tell the browser when to stop doing something. There are
  many different kinds of tags, and each one has a different purpose.

  Let's think of tags like it's some kind of selection tool in text editors.
  In text editor, such as Microsoft Office Word or Writer, if you want to
  make text bold you select a part of text and click corresponding button
  (b). In HTML, you have tags for that reason.

                     ┌── a "selected" text ──┐
                     ↓                       ↓
     Lorem ipsum <tagname>dolor sit amet</tagname>, consectetur adipisicing elit.

  Opening tags have a keyword, such as p, surrounded by angle brackets (<
  and >). For example, the tag <p> tells the browser the start a new
  paragraph. Ending tags look almost exactly the same, only they have a
  forward slash (/) added just before the keyword. For example, the tag </p>
  tells the browser to end a paragraph.

     <p>this is a paragraph</p>

  A small number of tags, like <br>, <img> and <hr>, can be used without an
  ending tag. Here is what these tags do:

   » <br> - produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful
     for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is
     significant.
   » <img> — represents an image in the document. We will consider this tag
     later.
   » <hr> — represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements. In
     previous versions of HTML, it represented a horizontal rule. It may
     still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers.

  You could use them like this:

     <p>first paragraph</p>
     <hr>
     <p>second paragraph</p>

 ### Basic HTML document

  In previous exercise you've created a document. Let's consider its
  content:

     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
       <head>
         <meta charset="utf-8">
         <title>Hello, world!</title>
       </head>
       <body>
         here is a body
       </body>
     </html>

  Here we have a <html> tag which wrap whole document — this tag indicates
  where HTML document begins and where it ends.

  HTML document had its own <head> and <body>. In the <head> tag we put all
  information about document, like meta-tags and <title>. The content of
  <title> tag will be shown in browser's tag of this document. In the <body>
  we put everything we want to be drawn in browser's window: headings, text,
  images, etc.

  Probably, you still have a question: "What does <meta charset="utf-8"> tag
  do?" Well, this is special tag — a meta-tag. Meta-tags are used for
  describing a document. It's a bit weird, but keep thinking about meta-tags
  as an information about information. Directly, this tag means that we want
  to use utf-8 charset for our document.

 ## THE CHALLENGE

  You already have an HTML-document. In <body> add two paragraphs (<p>) with
  any text you like. Please, separate these two tags with horizontal rule
  (<hr> tag).

  Don't forget to check your solution, run learnyouhtml verify to verify.
